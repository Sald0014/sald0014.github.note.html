<h2>About me...</h2>

<p> Hey! My name is Sofia Saldana, an international student who is currently taking the interactive media design program at Algonquin College and I will be sharing some facts about me on this website. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> post secondary education after finishing highschool back in my home country, I'm from Panama city, Panama and my first language is Spanish, I learnt English mostly by consuming social media, watching youtube and reading. </p>

<p> I really dont have a lot of knowledge in web development, so this is my first time learning about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and I'm <strong>super excited</strong> to learn new things regarding this course. My first option before choosing this program was the animation program, I <em> love </em> digital art and my works are heavily inspired by video games, anime, and western animation. My favorite music genres are jpop and jrock, Zutomayo being my favorite band of the genre. I decided to take this program because I feel it tackles a lot of different areas in the media and design industry.</P>

  <q> You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want. </q> <cite> -Ging Freecss </cite>
